This addon (currently for Ashita v3 only) prints out each trust you have not yet gained on your current character. That's it. That's all it does.

If you are looking for commands to save/load sets of trusts etc, there are other addons that do that.

Just drop the script in a folder of the same name in your addons directory, like : `C:\ashita\addons\TrustMe` (or wherever your ashita is).

Possible future plans: output trust have/have not list to a file the player can use as a checklist out side the game. Maybe. If I feel like it. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
